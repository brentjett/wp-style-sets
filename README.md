# WP Style Sets API

A concept plugin for creating a set of styles to be compiled and output as either a file or style block.

The idea is that you can create a style set and then add pieces of css/less/sass to it that is ultimately rendered out and cached as a file or, if intended as a style block, in a transient field in the options table.
